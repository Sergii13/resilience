                        system, the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information. Depending on
                        whether the user is attempting to gain access to a particular online service feature, we may
                        collect and use usernames, passwords, and other login information (to include name and contact
                        information). We may also use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies (such as
                        scripts and tags) on our online services. In some cases, we link the information gathered by
                        cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to a user’s personal information. We use
                        cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to help our online services function
                        properly, to collect information about how users interact and use our online services, and to
                        ensure the security of our network and related networks.Our website offers a publicly accessible

                        dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern
                        or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held
                        by us is among the assets transferred We may transfer or provide access to personal information

                    Your Information</h4>
                    <p>Resilience may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
                        that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
                        process served on Resilience, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Resilience or its
                        customers or users, or (c) under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
                        Resilience users, customers, or the general public. Resilience partners with third-party
                        entities to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share
                        names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these
                        services. Resilience may aggregate data we acquire about our users. If we aggregate such data
                        and provide it to external parties, our users’ personal information will not be attached to or
                        included in such aggregated data. Also, in the event that all or a portion of Resilience or its
                        assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of
                        these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users,
                        including personal information and user data in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale,
                        or other change of control. Resilience does not sell, rent, or share personal information with
                        third parties for their direct marketing purposes, including as defined under California Civil
                        Code Sec. 1798.83.</p><h4>How We Protect Your Information</h4>
                    <p>We take commercially reasonable measures as required by law to protect against loss, misuse,
                        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction of your personal information.
                        This includes physical, logical, electronic, and managerial safeguards such as hosting
                        information on cloud-based services and limiting internal access to information on a
                        need-to-know basis. There is, however, risk involved in transmitting information over the
                        internet, and, for that reason, Resilience cannot guarantee the security and privacy of
                        transmissions over the internet. Resilience will not be liable for any damages resulting from
                        the loss of privacy or security which occurs in connection with any such communication.</p>
