                        resilience (n.)
                    </h3>
                    <p>1620s, "act of rebounding or springing back." From Latin resiliens, "to rebound, recoil," In
                        physical
                        sciences, the meaning "elasticity, power of returning to original shape after compression, etc."
                        by
                        1824. – Online Etymology Dictionary</p>
                    <h3>The Risk Of Isolation</h3>
                    <p>In the not too distant past, when capital flowed and postponing profitability was a badge of
                        honor,
                        finance teams transferred risk and security teams mitigated it – often in complete isolation.
                        They
                        didn’t align their objectives – nor were they motivated to do so. Afterall, times were good
                        and
                        nobody seemed to care.
                    </p>
                    <p> Due to severe financial headwinds, security budgets are now scrutinized and the value of
                        insurance
                        is brought into question. This too is done in isolation – which courts catastrophe. As budgets
                        for
                        security controls get cut, the likelihood of compromise grows. Similarly, as insurance
                        investment
                        shrinks, the likelihood of loss grows. One cost-cutting effort compounds the other.</p>
                    <h3>
                        The Need For Shared Objectives
                    </h3>
                    <p>When isolation of responsibility and financial duress meet, it naturally leads to cost cutting.
                        The
                        knife will be raised without an integrated view of the cost of risks to the organization being
                        calculated. Leadership calls it risk acceptance. But can risks truly be accepted that haven’t
                        been
                        calculated? No. That’s nothing more than unstructured worry, as one praying to Fortuna (lady
                        luck)
                        hoping to avoid a bad day.
                    </p>
                    <p> The good news is that you can structure and manage your worries. It requires finance and
                        security to
                        share, align, and prioritize strategic objectives. Those objectives consider how business
                        opportunity and risk mitigation work together –particularly when under duress - and support
                        making
                        informed trade-offs when necessary. We call this alignment of objectives Cyber Resilience.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> To be successful in this digital economy, a company must now be Cyber Resilient - integrate
                            its
                            Risk
                            Mitigation, Risk Acceptance, and Risk Transfer in a way that it can take a digital hit
                            without
                            it
                            impacting its material ability to deliver value.</p>
                        <p> Or in other words, drive continuous improvement through continuous engagement across Risk,
                            Cybersecurity, and Finance.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>It operates on a core set of foundational principles and practices that tear down the walls of
                        isolated objectives.</p>
                    <h2>
                        The Principles Of Cyber Resilience
                    </h2>
                    <h3>Cyber Resilience tolerates losses – within limits. </h3>
                    <p>This is different to most security strategies, which portray complete loss elimination as an end
                        goal. Operating with shared, aligned, and prioritized objectives reveals what the business can
                        tolerate to lose – without incurring operational disruption. For example, “With this
                        configuration of controls, we can live with a 5% chance of losing $10 million and a 1% chance of
                        losing $25 million…”</p>
                    <h3>Cyber Resilience connects security with insurance – avoiding silos. </h3>
                    <p>Security investments reduce the likelihood of loss. Insurance investments reduce impact. They
                        work together (as opposed to in isolation) to keep risk within tolerance. That means they
                        adjust both the probabilities and dollar-based impacts expressed above as important trade-offs
                        are considered.</p>
                    <h3>Cyber Resilience seeks capital efficiency - while preventing hazards. </h3>
                    <p>Cyber Resilience seeks capital efficiency - while preventing hazards. </p>
                    <h3>Cyber Resilience makes cybersecurity visible – so it can be managed.</h3>
                    <p> Keeping risk within tolerance requires seeing what’s coming, counting the costs, and responding
                        in kind. This starts with the integrated trio of threat intelligence, vulnerability management,
                        and incident response. Security data is analyzed in relation to the financial losses your
                        business may face. Losses include things like: data breach, business disruption, extortion,
                        wire-fraud and more. Analysis leads to optimized decisions –decisions that cut across
                        investment strategies and day-to-day security operations.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Cyber Resilience Incentivizes the right cyber hygiene behaviors - you’re creating the
                            virtuous loop.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h2>The Practices Of Cyber Resilience</h2>
                    <p>If you want to be a cyber resilient leader, you need to embrace the principles of resilience and
                        learn the following practices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Superforecasting: </strong>Cyber resilient leaders are resourceful and know how
                                to make accurate
                                measurements and judgements about important events that can affect key objectives. They
                                are trained in forecasting and are able to prove their skills over time and against
                                their peers.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Calculating Value at Risk:</strong> Cyber resilient leaders know how to
                                accurately gauge the
                                potential losses they face from several perils using rapid risk assessments.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>
                            <strong>Forecasting The Likelihood of Loss:</strong> Cyber resilient leaders assess the
                            probabilities
                            that given perils materialize, and then evaluate the probability adjusted Value at Risk.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Investing Based On ROI:</strong> Cyber resilient leaders identify which controls
                            are required to
                            reduce the probability of events, and evaluate their costs and ROI for implementing them
                            without introducing additional moral hazard.</p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            <strong>Risk Acceptance and Transfer:</strong> Cyber resilient leaders clarify how much
                            structured worry
                            their organization is willing to tolerate and how much insurance it should be willing to
                            purchase.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Presenting to the Board/Budgeting Committee:</strong> Cyber resilient leaders
                            tell the money
                            people what is needed and why in economic terms – and they have the data and reasoned
                            forecasts to defend their budgets when scrutinized.</p></li>
